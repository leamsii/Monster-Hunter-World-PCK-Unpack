# Monster-Hunter-World-PCK-Unpack
<p>
A quick and dirty script that extracts the .wem files inside Monster Hunter World .pck files. 
It also works with Magic The Gathering Arena game.

<h4>Credits to Adam Gashlin (https://github.com/hcs64) for the wem2ogg converter</h4>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Simply drag and drop the .pck file onto the pck_unpack.py script. The script will create an "extracted" folder and place all the .wem files
inside already converted to ogg format. The script will also take .npck files.

<h3>Happy modding!</h3>
